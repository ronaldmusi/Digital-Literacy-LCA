Digital Literacy and Adolescent Girls Empowerment in Nigeria: A Latent Class Analysis

Background
Globally, 1.3 billion people are between the ages of 10–19 years, with 90% living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Adolescence is a critical period marked by extensive biological, psychological, and social changes. Digital literacy is crucial in adolescent development, enabling children to confidently navigate digital environments for learning, socializing, and civic participation. Despite its importance, many teenage girls still lack these critical digital skills.

Empowering adolescent girls through digital literacy can provide them with access to information, choices, and opportunities. It can address multidimensional child poverty by allowing girls to access educational resources, health services, and information. For example, in Tanzania, girls who received digital literacy training were able to use online tools effectively, evaluate information quality, and understand privacy and security. Moreover, digital literacy can empower girls to make informed decisions about their health and well-being.

However, barriers such as poverty and limited access to digital infrastructure must be addressed to ensure that digital literacy initiatives reach those who need them most.

Research Objectives
This study aims to explore the relationship between digital literacy, demographic features, and empowerment among adolescent girls in a low-income setting. We use Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to categorize girls based on their digital literacy levels. LCA groups individuals into different classes using latent features like digital skills, financial literacy, and digital competence. We then examine how these digital literacy levels relate to demographic features and empowerment outcomes.

Methods
Data
We utilize baseline data from the “Adolescent Girls Initiative for Learning and Empowerment: Impact Evaluation of a Safe Space-Based Life Skills Training and Digital Literacy Training in Rural Nigeria, 2023.” Participants include randomly selected secondary school girls aged 15 to 20 from rural and semi-urban schools.
